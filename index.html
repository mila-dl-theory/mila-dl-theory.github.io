<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>
Mila's Deep Learning Theory Group is a discussion group aimed at keeping up with the latest research, and collaborating and brainstorming to push the boundaries of theoretical aspects of deep learning. We meet every Thursday at 11:00 AM EST. The guidelines and schedule are provided in this website while poolings and internal discussions are conducted in <a href='https://join.slack.com/share/zt-fpcg0841-7i2sZPEdf~rzR8PgsSEwrA'> Mila's Slack Channel </a>.
</p>

<h3> Guidelines</h3>

<p>
<b>Structure:</b>
Each meeting is managed by one or a few leaders. Based on the topic, the leader will have a ~10-20 minutes presentation about the background. The leader can choose to present the topic on high-level or detailed. For example the leader can choose to

<ul>
<li>summarize ideas in a specific paper.</li>
<li>or describe high-level background and key challenges on the topic of research and the high-level approaches to tackle the challenges and provide intuition.</li>
<li>or describe a high-level topic and mention their half-baked ideas around the topic.</li>
</ul>
</p><p>The leader can choose however they want to present the background, it can be slides, notes, going over a paper or even just speaking. After presenting the background, there will be a ~40 minutes discussion. The leader should lead the discussion and encourage the engagement of participants by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Highlighting possible points of discussion/goals to achieve during the session.</li>
<li>Asking questions, example: Of the ideas presented/discussed, is there something you want to know more about?</li>
<li>Ask participants to brainstorm ideas</li>
</ul>
<p>
The last ~5 minutes of every meeting is spent to select the topic of the next meeting based on the votes and interests of the participants (available in the excel or website). 
</p>
<p>In each session there will also be a facilitator. The role of the facilitator is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Introduce the leader and their area of expertise.</li>
<li>Encourage inclusive (rather than unilateral) discussions.</li>
<li>Ask a participant for their opinion on a specific question.</li>
<li>Perhaps call a participantâ€™s name in chat and ask them to chime in and explain their ideas.</li>
<li>Ensure that everyone who wants to speak up gets a chance to do so, and no voices are left out.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
<b>Note</b>: The goal is to have meetings that are stand-alone so that if someone missed one meeting, they would not have to worry about not being able to follow the next meeting.
